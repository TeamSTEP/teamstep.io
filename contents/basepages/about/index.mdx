## Who are we?

Team STEP is a team of aspiring indie game developers who loves to play and make games. We are not a fully-funded indie game studio yet, and all the team members are working under the rev-share model.
If you love creating games just for the fun of it or want to learn how to get into the game industry, you've come to the right place!

## What do we do?

We work with various programming languages and engines with a wide range of game genres. Our work also includes tools and plugins for multiple platforms that can help game developers.
You can see more works from our Github page: <https://github.com/TeamSTEP>.
