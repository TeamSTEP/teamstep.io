title: Palette
description: Palette is a 2D side-scroller platformer made in RPG Maker VX Ace. This game tries the impossible by creating a 2D side-scroller with a full physics engine for a game engine that was primarily meant for creating a simple 2D top-down RPG without coding. But we did it with Ruby.

## About the Project

Palette is a 2D side-scroller game that uses the Arc Engine, a Ruby script that adds a fully-functional platform collider mask with simulated gravity to your RPG Maker VX Ace game.
It has a storybook-style visual.
